My name is Karissa Lowe, and I am a Data Analyst with a passion for creativity, problem solving, and data equity practices. Iâ€™m using this blog as a garden to grow my knowledge of Data Analysis, Microsoft Power Apps, Power Bi, and the magic of R, SQL, Python. Please join me as I share my journey learning about all of the above and more!
